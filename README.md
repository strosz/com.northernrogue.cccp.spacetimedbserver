## Getting Started
   - Install the asset using this .git URL in the Package Manager¬¥s + menu.<br>
   ```https://github.com/strosz/com.northernrogue.cccp.spacetimedbserver.git```
   - A Welcome Window displays if successful with a link to the Server Installer Window which will determine if you have everything necessary to run SpacetimeDB on Windows WSL. Install the listed free and publicly available software one by one starting from the top. 
   - Now you can run SpacetimeDB directly from Unity!

   **Note:** The Server Installer Window works by automatically calling install commands from public repositories for you. It creates a temporary bat file in your Windows temp folder in order to reliably run the installer process. For a manual install process please check the documentation button available in the Welcome Window.

## Upcoming Features
   - New command interface with all commands.
   - Better user experience and tips for how to solve common STDB questions.
